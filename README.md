# Pokemon-GAN
### List of Tasks:
* Ajith
    * Pick up when Sahil finishes
* Sahil
    * process images in octave
### Project Roadmap:
* Design a working dataset [Finish by Sept. 15]
    * Find one
    * Make a list of appropriate manipulations
    * Extract features
 * Develop the code for the GAN
    * The Discriminator - (forward prop)
    * The Generator - (forward prop)
    * Output Probability Functions
    * Loss functions
    * Backpropogation
    * Minibatching
    * Put everything together into a training algorithm 
        * 60/20/20 training, validation, testing
 * Fine-tune the GAN and troubleshoot
    * Regularization
    * Make Learning Curves
    * Overfitting (+data), Underfitting (+features)
    * Advanced Optimization
### Notes:
 * too many arceus?
